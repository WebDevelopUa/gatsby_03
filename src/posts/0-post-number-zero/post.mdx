  <h4>
    Processes images in markdown so they can be used in the production build
  </h4>
  <FaInfo className="nice-text-icon" />

In the processing, it makes images responsive by:

- Adding an elastic container to hold the size of the image while it loads to avoid layout jumps.
- Generating multiple versions of images at different widths and sets the srcset and sizes of the img element so regardless of the width of the device, the correct image is downloaded.
- Using the “blur up” technique popularized by Medium and Facebook where a small 20px wide version of the image is shown as a placeholder until the actual image is downloaded.

### Install

`npm install gatsby-remark-images gatsby-plugin-sharp`

<br />
<br />

### How to use

```javascript
// In your gatsby-config.js
plugins: [
  `gatsby-plugin-sharp`,
  {
    resolve: `gatsby-transformer-remark`,
    options: {
      plugins: [
        {
          resolve: `gatsby-remark-images`,
          options: {
            // It's important to specify the maxWidth (in pixels) of
            // the content container as this plugin uses this as the
            // base for generating different widths of each image.
            maxWidth: 590,
          },
        },
      ],
    },
  },
]
```

<br />
<br />

### Usage in Markdown

<br />

## inline image from `"src/assets"` folder

You can reference an image using the relative path, where that path is relative to the location of the Markdown file you’re typing in.

`![Alt text here](./image.jpg)`

By default, the text Alt text here will be used as the alt attribute of the generated img tag.
If an empty alt attribute like alt="" is wished, a reserved keyword GATSBY_EMPTY_ALT can be used.

`![GATSBY_EMPTY_ALT](./image.png)`

<div className="mdx-img">

![inline image from `"src/assets"` folder](../../assets/banner-about.jpg)

</div>

  A wonderful serenity has taken possession of my entire soul, like these sweet
  mornings of spring which I enjoy with my whole heart. I am alone, and feel the
  charm of existence in this spot, which was created for the bliss of souls like
  mine. I am so happy, my dear friend, so absorbed in the exquisite sense of
  mere tranquil existence, that I neglect my talents. I should be incapable of
  drawing a single stroke at the present moment; and yet I feel that I never was
  a greater artist than now. When, while the lovely valley teems with vapour
  around me, and the meridian sun strikes the upper surface of the impenetrable
  foliage of my trees, and but a few stray gleams steal into the inner
  sanctuary, I throw myself down among the tall grass by the trickling stream;
  and, as I lie close to the earth, a thousand unknown plants are noticed by me:
  when I hear the buzz of the little world among the stalks, and grow familiar
  with the countless indescribable forms of the insects and flies, then I feel
  the presence of the Almighty, who formed us in his own image, and the breath

  Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and
  Consonantia, there live the blind texts. Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove
  right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language ocean. A small river
  named Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary
  regelialia. It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences
  fly into your mouth. Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control about the
  blind texts it is an almost unorthographic life One day however a small line
  of blind text by the name of Lorem Ipsum decided to leave for the far World of
  Grammar. The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands
  of bad Commas, wild Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind
  Text didn’t listen. She packed her seven versalia, put her initial into the
  belt and made herself on the way. When she reached the first hills of the
  Italic Mountains, she had a last view back on the skyline of her hometown
  Bookmarksgrove, the headline of Alphabet Village and the subline of her own
